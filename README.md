<br/>
SecureText is a program designed to protect text data from unauthorized access. The program can protect any text with several encryption and decryption algorithms. Also, the user can combine several algorithms to get the best result. The high degree of text protection allows the user to send it to third parties without fear for confidentiality.

## Application Description

To use the SecureText application you need to enter a password that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the text. After that, the user just needs to write the desired text and press the appropriate button (Encrypt or Decrypt).

<n/>

After the procedure is completed, the program will inform the user about the successful completion of the operation.

The SecureText contains the following encryption and decryption algorithms:

* AES-256
* Triple DES
* Extended Triple DES
* Triple DES (2 rounds)
* Triple DES (4 rounds)
* RC4
* ROT13
* Base64

<n/>

After the program creates the ciphertext, the user will be able to transfer it to third parties. They must use the same program to decrypt the text, entering the password you used to encrypt the text and the decryption algorithm. After that, the program will decrypt the ciphertext and the user will receive the original text.

Also, to ensure the greatest security of the text, the user can use several encryption algorithms using different passwords. In this case, the user who will decrypt the text must select the decryption algorithms in reverse order and enter the passwords corresponding to the encryption algorithms.
